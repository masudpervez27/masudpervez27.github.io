In the first part of this series, we trained a chatbot intent classifier using **BERT** and **PyTorch**. Now, weâ€™ll take this trained model from the development environment to a production-ready API! Deploying your model is essential because it allows your application, whether itâ€™s a chatbot, customer service assistant, or another service, to serve predictions in real time.

## Why Deployment Matters

Training a model is only half the journey; **deployment** makes it accessible and functional for users. By creating an API with **FastAPI**, weâ€™ll be able to:
- **Serve predictions**: Our model can respond to requests instantly, allowing users to interact with the chatbot.
- **Integrate with other systems**: An API endpoint allows any application (web, mobile, etc.) to send text to our model and receive its intent prediction.
- **Scale up**: A deployed model can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously, making it suitable for real-world applications.

In this guide, weâ€™ll cover every step to save our trained model, load it for inference, and create a FastAPI endpoint. By the end, our intent classifier will be able to handle requests and return real-time predictions, ready for seamless integration into any chatbot system. Letâ€™s get started!
