👋 Hey there! I’m Masud!
I’m a passionate Data Scientist on a mission to uncover the secrets of data and blend innovation with insights.

🌟 With over 7 years of experience, I currently tackle fraud detection at a bank, using advanced machine learning models to spot suspicious activities. Before this, I developed models for customer retention, lifetime value predictions, and recommendation systems.

🤖 I’m particularly fascinated by Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and can’t wait to dive deeper into these exciting fields! I also have a solid foundation in forecasting and statistical analysis.

📊 I thrive on working with large datasets, from cleaning and processing to extracting valuable insights. My toolkit includes regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, all powered by my love for Python and its amazing libraries like Pandas, PyTorch, and Matplotlib. I’ve also been involved in building practical AI systems!

🏸 In my free time, I love to play badminton and am passionate about photography and video editing. I enjoy learning new things that pique my interest!
